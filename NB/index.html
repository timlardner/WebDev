						<h1>About Me</h1>
						
						<img src="images/neil.jpg" align="right" alt="Image" title="Image" class="articleimg1" />
						
						<p>I am a graduate in philosophy from Edinburgh University. In my twenties and thirties I worked as a professional performer in music, dance and theatre. I was the singer/songwriter for a rock band that achieved considerable local and national success.</p>
						<p>The band toured with Jools Holland and enjoyed a lot of airplay and good press. We were known for our musicianship and song writing.
						<p>I now write songs for other younger acts and work as a voice-over artist.
						<p>I have many years of teaching experience with young bands and individuals and have taught song writing and composition both as a night class for The City of  Edinburgh Council and also in a classroom situation.</p>
